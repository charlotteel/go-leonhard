Maths problems! More specifically, Python solutions to the problems set by Project Euler at https://projecteuler.net/problems

I'm working my way through the list in order to practise using Python and figure out new and fun ways to solve stuff.
This means my solutions might look horrible if you're not a beginner like me!
